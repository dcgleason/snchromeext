# Icon Files

The extension requires the following icon files in the `/images` directory:

- `icon-16.png` (16x16)
- `icon-32.png` (32x32)
- `icon-48.png` (48x48)
- `icon-128.png` (128x128)

You can create these icons using any image editor software. The icons should represent the extension's functionality (ServiceNow to OpenAI integration).

## Creating Icons

1. Use a simple, recognizable design that works well at small sizes
2. Ensure your design works in both light and dark browser themes
3. Save in PNG format with transparency
4. Make sure all sizes are properly scaled versions of the same design

## Example Design Ideas

- A combination of the ServiceNow and OpenAI logos
- A stylized "SN" with an AI symbol
- A data transformation icon (e.g., XML to chat bubbles)
- A brain icon with database symbols

## Placing Icons

Place all icon files in the `/images` directory of your extension.
